# 🐦 Migratory Birds and Climate Change: R Project

## 📌 Project Goal
To analyze the impact of climate change on migratory bird species using open-access biodiversity and climate datasets, and to visualize threats, habitat conditions, and conservation statuses through R.

## 🗂️ Project Structure


## 📊 Data Sources Used
- **GBIF** – Global Biodiversity Information Facility  
- **eBird** – Bird observation data  
- **WorldClim** – Global climate data  
- **IUCN Red List** – Conservation status and threats

## 📈 Tools & Techniques
- R Markdown for dynamic reporting
- ggplot2 for data visualization
- dplyr and tidyr for data manipulation
- readxl and openxlsx for Excel data
- knitr and rmarkdown for report generation

## 🧠 Key Findings
- [Summarize your 2–3 main conclusions, e.g.:]  
  Migratory birds are experiencing range shifts due to rising temperatures and habitat loss. Species under IUCN’s endangered categories are especially vulnerable in fragmented habitats.

## 📄 How to Run This Project
1. Open `MigratoryBirds_Report.Rmd` in RStudio.
2. Install required R packages (listed in the Rmd).
3. Click **Knit** to generate the report in HTML/PDF format.
